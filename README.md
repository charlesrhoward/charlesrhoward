# Hey, I'm Charles 👋

**Founder of [Webrenew](https://webrenew.com)** — we build tools that make developers and businesses move faster.

I went from no-code automation to building full-stack AI products. Now I spend my time creating open-source developer tools, shipping AI-powered applications, and helping businesses automate everything that should've been automated years ago.

### What I'm Building

🧠 **[memories](https://github.com/webrenew/memories)** — Persistent memory layer for AI agents. One memory system that works across Claude Code, Cursor, and every AI tool you use.

🎨 **[unicon](https://github.com/webrenew/unicon)** — Shadcn for icons. 19,000+ icons from every major icon library, unified into one developer-friendly package.

✏️ **[drawit](https://github.com/webrenew/drawit)** — An Excalidraw-inspired diagramming tool with agentic AI support for generating diagrams, flowcharts, and wireframes.

🤖 **[models-dilemma](https://github.com/webrenew/models-dilemma)** — The Prisoner's Dilemma, but played by LLMs. A unique approach to evaluating how AI models cooperate, compete, and strategize.
